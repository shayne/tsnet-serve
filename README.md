# tsnet-serve

It's like `tailscale serve` but a standalone app that lives on your tailnet.

A tsnet app that runs a lightweight reverse proxy on your tailnet.
Give it a hostname, backend, and provide an auth key.
The app will appear on your tailnet as a machine.

Tailscale provides connectivity, a TLS cert, and
runs the same reverse proxy as `tailscale serve`.

Open a web browser and point it to `https://machine.your-tcd.ts.net`.

Expose your service to the internet via [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel/)
using the `-funnel` flag.
